# Publishing to Chrome Web Store - Guide

This guide will walk you through publishing the ABUGO Intercom Actions extension to the Chrome Web Store for easy distribution to your team.

## Prerequisites

1. **Google Account** - Use your work Google account (e.g., @abugo.com)
2. **$5 One-time Fee** - Chrome Web Store developer registration fee
3. **Extension Files** - All files ready in the `intercom` folder

## Step 1: Register as a Chrome Web Store Developer

1. Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Pay the **$5 one-time registration fee**
4. Accept the Developer Agreement

**Note:** This fee is one-time and covers unlimited extensions.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Extension

### 2.1 Check Manifest Version

Ensure your `manifest.json` has:
- Proper version number (e.g., `"version": "1.0.0"`)
- Complete description
- All required permissions

### 2.2 Create Icons (Optional but Recommended)

Create icon files for the store:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

**Quick option:** You can use online tools or create simple icons. The extension will work without them, but they improve the store listing.

### 2.3 Create Zip File for Upload

Create a zip file with **only** the files needed for the extension:

```bash
cd extensions/intercom
zip -r intercom-store.zip . -x "*.pem" "*.crx" "*.zip" "*.git*" "README.md" "INSTALLATION.md" "PUBLISHING.md" "SHARING.md"
```

**Files to include:**
- ✅ `manifest.json`
- ✅ `content.js`
- ✅ `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png` (if you have them)

**Files to exclude:**
- ❌ `.pem` files (private keys)
- ❌ `.crx` files (will be generated by Chrome)
- ❌ Documentation files (README, INSTALLATION, etc.)
- ❌ `.git` files

## Step 3: Upload to Chrome Web Store

1. Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
2. Click **"New Item"** or **"Add new item"**
3. Click **"Choose file"** and select your `intercom-store.zip` file
4. Click **"Upload"**
5. Wait for Chrome to process and validate your extension

## Step 4: Fill Out Store Listing

## Step 5: Submit for Review

**Review Criteria:**

## Updating the Extension

   - Major version (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) for breaking changes
